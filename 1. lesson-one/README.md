# what is CLI app
If you are from a non programming backgroud, there are chances you have never interacted with a CLI app. Those are pretty obsolete now from the end user scene. But programmers use them all the time.

Most of the tools in a programmers toolkit is CLI: github, shell, programming language repls etc. are all CLIs. In strictest terms, if you are interacting with a program via command line (that black thing with text on it which hackers use in movies) then it's a CLI (Command Line INTERFACE).

Think of it as texting with a program instead of you know the usual clicking of buttons.
